* Installation Changes in Emacs 27.1


* Startup Changes in Emacs 27.1

+++
** Emacs can now be configured using an early init file.
The file is called early-init.el, in `user-emacs-directory'.  It is
loaded very early in the startup process: in particular, before
graphical elements such as the tool bar are initialized, and before
the package manager is initialized.

+++
** Emacs now initializes package.el before loading the init-file.
This is part of a change intended to eliminate the behavior of
package.el inserting a call to (package-initialize) into the
init-file, which was previously done when Emacs was started.  Users
who do not configure package.el variables such as `package-load-list'
and `package-user-dir' need not make any configuration changes.  Users
who do configure such variables should place the configuration into
the newly introduced early init file, which is loaded before
package.el is initialized.
